# Cricket-Team-Manager

I have added the functionality of -
1) Sign up authentication - Firebase authetication 
2) Add player details - Cloud Firestore 
3) Sign out - Firebase authetication

I have used -
1)Provider Package - for state management. This helps in managing the state of logged in or logged out

2)Used a Model class to manage the Player details  - Name, Type(Batsman/Bowler), Age

I still have to -
1) work on the UI of the app
2) remove a player from the list
3) add more details to player - ODI Career (Total Runs/Wickets, Strike Rate, Economy (if heâ€™s a bowler))

I aim to complete the whole project by 4 in the evening
